slurmstepd-cn01: error: *** JOB 40 ON cn01 CANCELLED AT 2025-09-18T15:23:24 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[57173,0],0] on node cn01
  Remote daemon: [[57173,0],1] on node cn02

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
